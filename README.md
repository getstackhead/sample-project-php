# PHP sample project

This is a sample repository for deploying a PHP application and serving it on a domain using [StackHead, the Open-Source Web Server management](https://github.com/getstackhead/deployment).

It provides examples for deploying a single and multi container applications.

## Requirements

In order to try out this sample project, you'll need the following:

* [StackHead CLI binary file](https://docs.stackhead.io/v/next/introduction/installation)
* [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
* a web server with root SSH access (we recommend renting a [pay-per-use VPS at Hetzner. Get 20â‚¬ cloud balance for free](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=n7H3qhWcZ2QS))
* a top level (sub) domain with A record pointing to your server IP

Initialize StackHead by running the command below.
This will install all dependencies required.

```shell script
stackhead-cli init
```

## How to use

### Server provisioning

```bash
stackhead-cli setup [IP_ADDRESS]
```

After provisioning completed, you should see the Nginx default page when opening your domain in your browser.

### Application deployment

The following sections describe how to configure the samples for your server and domain.
There are two differently sized projects, consisting of one single container and multiple containers.

#### Single container application

1. Adjust the project settings in `.stackhead/project/example_container_single.yml`
   1. Set your own domain in `domain`

2. Validate your project file using the `validate` command:
   ```bash
   stackhead-cli validate .stackhead/project/example_container_single.yml
   ```

3. Deploy the application. Make sure to replace `[IP_ADDRESS]` with your servers IP address.
    ```bash
    stackhead-cli deploy ./.stackhead/example_container_single.yml [IP_ADDRESS]
    ```

4. After deployment, open the domain in your web browser. You should see a page that prints "Hello world!" alongside the PHP version and successful database connection.

5. Remove the application:

```shell script
stackhead-cli destroy example_container_single
```

#### Multi container application

1. Adjust the project settings in `.stackhead/project/example_container_multi.yml`
   1. Set your own domain in `domain`

3. Validate your project file using the `validate` command:
   ```bash
   stackhead-cli validate .stackhead/project/example_container_multi.yml
   ```

3. Deploy the application. Make sure to replace `[IP_ADDRESS]` with your servers IP address.
    ```bash
    stackhead-cli deploy ./.stackhead/project/example_container_multi.yml [IP_ADDRESS]
    ```

4. After deployment, open the domain in your web browser.
You should see a page that prints "Hello world!" alongside the PHP version and successful database connection.

    You can access PhpMyAdmin on port 81 (no HTTPS).

5. Remove the application:

```shell script
stackhead-cli destroy example_container_multi
```
